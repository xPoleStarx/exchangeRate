# Currency Exchange Rate Calculator

This is a simple Python script that calculates the exchange rate between two currencies using the ExchangeRate API. It takes user input for the base currency, the target currency, and the amount to be exchanged.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Requests library (pip install requests)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script file (\`exchange_rate_calculator.py\`).
2. Install the Requests library if you haven't already (pip install requests).
3. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the script using the command \`python exchange_rate_calculator.py\`.
5. Follow the prompts and enter the required information:
   - Enter the currency you want to exchange from (e.g., USD).
   - Enter the currency you want to exchange to (e.g., EUR).
   - Enter the amount you want to exchange.
6. The script will fetch the latest exchange rates from the ExchangeRate API and calculate the converted amount.
7. The result will be displayed in the terminal.
\`\`\`
$ python exchange_rate_calculator.py
What currency do you want to exchange?: USD
What currency do you want to exchange to?: EUR
Enter the amount you want to exchange: 100

You can find more information about the API and its documentation on the [ExchangeRate API website](https://www.exchangerate-api.com).

Note: The ExchangeRate API used in this script is subject to change or may have usage limitations. Please refer to the API documentation for any updates or usage guidelines.
